Over the past few decades, computers have played a transformative role in digitizing the world’s knowledge i.e. converting physical information such as books, documents, scientific research, media, and human experiences into searchable digital formats. This digitization not only preserved information but made it universally accessible, forming the foundation of the modern knowledge economy.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) marked the next major leap. LLMs enabled us to search, interpret, and interact with this digital knowledge in intuitive and human-like ways—even when the information exists in multimodal formats such as text, images, audio, and video. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex systems or structured query languages, LLMs made it possible to communicate with technology in natural language, unlocking unprecedented accessibility and utility.

As we look ahead, the next stepping stone is not just accessing information but generating novel insights and solutions—augmenting human creativity, innovation, and decision-making. This is where Project Beacon positions itself. By drawing inspiration from human psychology and cognitive processes that drive reasoning and problem-solving, Project Beacon aims to build a structured intelligence framework that goes beyond retrieval. The vision is to create a system that empowers both humans and machines to ideate, evaluate, and iterate on complex challenges collaboratively by mimicking huuman psychology that has driven innovation and problem solving for millennium.
